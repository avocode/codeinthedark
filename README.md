# Code in the Dark

[Code in the Dark](http://codeinthedark.com) is a front-end competition (HTML, CSS). Each competitor is asked to code a website based on a prepared print-screened design. The competitor cannot use the browser to preview what he has coded or any other tool for measuring. The audience votes for the best design resemblance after each 15min round.

## The rules

The rules are quite simple:

1. You get a plain picture of a web design
2. Try to imitate it the best you can in CSS and HTML without using the browser
3. You have 15 minutes
